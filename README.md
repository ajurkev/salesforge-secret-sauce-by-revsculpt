## Skills

| Skill | Command | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `salesforge-reference` | `/salesforge` | API rules, endpoints, variable mapping, defaults |
| `salesforge-sequence-creator` | `/salesforge-sequence` | **Main pipeline:** paste copy → create sequence in Salesforge (paused) |
| `salesforge-contact-manager` | `/salesforge-contacts` | Import contacts from local CSV or Clay export. Validate, dedupe, manage DNC |
| `salesforge-enrollment-manager` | `/salesforge-enroll` | Enroll contacts into sequences, monitor, pause/resume |
| `salesforge-deliverability-checker` | `/salesforge-health` | Mailbox warmup status, sender reputation, DNS health |

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI
- Salesforge account with API access
- Salesforge API key (Settings → Integrations → API Key)

## API Key Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations** in Salesforge
2. Click **Generate API Key**
3. Store the key — it's used in the `Authorization` header for all API calls

## API Coverage

All endpoints come from the official [Salesforge API v2 Swagger spec](https://api.salesforge.ai/public/v2/swagger/index.html). Two base URLs:

- **Core API:** `https://api.salesforge.ai/public/v2` — workspaces, contacts, mailboxes, webhooks, DNC
- **Multichannel API:** `https://multichannel-api.salesforge.ai/public` — sequences, nodes, enrollments, sender profiles, schedules
