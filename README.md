```

## Prerequisites

- Claude Code CLI
- Python 3.x with Playwright (`pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`)
- Salesforge API key (Settings → Integrations → API Key)
- Salesforge workspace with active mailboxes

## API Key Setup

Generate your API key in Salesforge:
1. Go to **Settings → Integrations**
2. Click **Generate API Key**
3. Store the key — you'll need it for API calls

> **Note:** Salesforge does not currently provide an official MCP server. These skills use direct HTTP API calls via the [Salesforge API v2](https://api.salesforge.ai/public/v2/swagger/index.html). If/when an official MCP becomes available, the reference skill will be updated.

## Compatibility

Works alongside the [Email Bison Campaign Skills](https://github.com/geeky-rambo/-claude-campaign-skills) — same spam-fixer and spintax-creator skills are reused. The sequence-creator orchestrator chains them automatically.

## Development Status

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Phase 1: Reference + Sequence Creator + Enrollment | ✅ Built |
| Phase 2: Contact Manager + Deliverability | ✅ Built |
| Phase 3: Leadsforge Search + Infraforge DNS | 🔜 Planned |

## API Coverage

All endpoints are derived from the official [Salesforge API v2 Swagger spec](https://api.salesforge.ai/public/v2/swagger/index.html). The API uses two base URLs:

- **Core API:** `https://api.salesforge.ai/public/v2` — workspaces, contacts, mailboxes, webhooks, DNC
- **Multichannel API:** `https://multichannel-api.salesforge.ai/public` — sequences, nodes, enrollments, sender profiles, schedules
